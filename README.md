# intersection
In Euclidean geometry, the intersection of a line and a line can be the empty set, a point, or a line. Distinguishing these cases and finding the intersection point have use, for example, in computer graphics, motion planning, and collision detection.

In three-dimensional Euclidean geometry, if two lines are not in the same plane they are called skew lines and have no point of intersection. If they are in the same plane there are three possibilities: if they coincide (are not distinct lines) they have an infinitude of points in common (namely all of the points on either of them); if they are distinct but have the same slope they are said to be parallel and have no points in common; otherwise they have a single point of intersection.

The distinguishing features of non-Euclidean geometry are the number and locations of possible intersections between two lines and the number of possible lines with no intersections (parallel lines) with a given line.

This program calculates the coordinates of two 2-D lines. Each line should be given with the end point ID's selected by the user and checked whether it is in the disk. The file structure is given with the format by Point ID, X, Y, Z. The user should enter the Point ID's of each line. If there is an intersection point for the given lines, the program should then ask the Point ID for the intersection porint to add the new point to the given file.
